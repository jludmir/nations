        <p>How I created solution: I pretty much followed the steps outlined. To be honest, this assignment was difficult for someone without a web programming background.
          <br />In particular, I found steps 6 and 7 very difficult: For step 6, the first issue that I was having was figuring out how scaleLinear worked, and how the mouse interactions were coded/worked.<br/>
           Next, after figuring out the reason you guys recommended it in the first place (i.e. to map the mouse's x-position to a year), <br/>
           I first removed the dots and then pretty much just copied over the code that made/plotted the dots from step 4 into both the mousemove and tween interactions, simply changing the years to the new year. <br/>
           <br/>After doing that, step 7 (adding the Voronoi) was a hassle. I had a hard time understanding how the code was supposed to be implemented, and only now understand the basics of what each piece does.
           <br/> I followed the walkthrough that you guys recommended until the tooltips (read in Piazza that we did not have to worry about that), and then did exactly what I did with the dots on mousemove/tween: <br/>
            I added a class to the voronoi paths called vorpath (otherwise removing all paths would delete the axes as well), then I removed the vorpaths on mousemove/tween. After, I rebuilt the Voronoi with the same code, just changed the year.
           <br/> Note: On step 4, I changed your template slightly such that we append the dot title in the same "line" as we append the dot itself.
           <br/> Another Note: When the script adds/removes dots, it leaves behind empty g tags. Doesn't impact the performance (I'm guessing if you drag the year around for like an hour it'll probably bug out due to the huge number of tags).
